# First order irrationality criteria for series

[LEE A. BUTLER](http://logicandanalysis.org/index.php/jla/article/view/233)

Corollary 2.2 in the paper is inspired by some work of `Viggo Brun`.
It is mentioned that Corollary 2.2 applies to the sequence qₙ below.
We verify that fact in `corollary_2_2_example` below.
In fact, the assumption `n ≥ 1` is not needed.
