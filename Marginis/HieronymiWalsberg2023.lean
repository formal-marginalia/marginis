Oscillation

Let f : (X, dX) → (Y, dY ) be
a function between metric spaces. The oscillation of f at x ∈ X is the supremum of all
δ ≥ 0 such that for every ε > 0 there are y,z ∈ X such that dX(x, y) < ε, dX(x,z) < ε
and dY (f(y), f(z)) > δ .
. Recall that f is continuous at x if and only if the oscillation of
f at x is zero.

-- We need to use `ENNReal` here since the oscillation may be ∞.
/--  `oscillation` was also added to Mathlib in 2024. We should prove that they coincide.
The results below can be proved for `oscillation` by observing that both functions are continuous.
