# Preface to the special issue for The Fifth Workshop on Formal Topology

[THIERRY COQUAND, MARIA EMILIA MAIETTI, and ERIK PALMGREN](http://logicandanalysis.org/index.php/jla/article/view/380)

The paper introduces Formal Topology, which is a constructive approach to pointfree topology.
Here we instead look at topologies *with points*, over finite sets and show:
 - there is a unique topology on `Fin 0`;
 - there is a unique topology on `Fin 1`;
 - there exist two distinct topologies on `Fin 2`
 - We also construct the remaining two topologies on `Fin 2` giving a total of 4,
   and show they are homeomorphic.
