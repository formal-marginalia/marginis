# Limit Laws and Automorphism Groups of Nonrigid Structures

[Ove Ahlman and Vera Koponen](http://logicandanalysis.org/index.php/jla/article/view/213)

The first sentence of the introduction reads as follows.

"[...] it has been shown that for any finite relational vocabulary (also called signature),
the proportion of labelled n-element structures which are rigid, ie have no nontrivial automorphism,
approaches 1 as n approaches infinity"

While their paper is about nonrigid structures, here we show that there exists a rigid 2-element structure, namely `Fin 2`
under addition.
